This is my fork of my final project for ES4 Intro to Digital Logic Circuits. The project is piano tiles style rythm game where the player gets to play the song Sleigh Ride. The entire project was built on an UPduino v3.1 development board which uses an ICE40UP5K FPGA and used an NES controller for player input and a speaker for playing music. The finished project is in the branch finished_v3 NOT main.
